BeagleBone-Black
================
- ver 0.0: The MLO is started up by the ROM and is generated by the
  “home-brewed” tool-chain that build the software and append the necessary 
  header on the MLO (see append_gp_header.c).

- ver 1.0: Setup the user led’s and the UART0 on the BBB for communication, 
  a “Hello world” snippet. So far the example depend on the ROM that sets up 
  the PLL’s and the clocks in a proper manner.

- ver 1.1: Fixed line formatting. Added a test setting up the clocks needed by 
  UART0. This is originally done by the ROM code, but this is overwriting the 
  ROM set-up and is just a pure test; remove it if you like, it doesn’t add any 
  extra value...
