BeagleBone-Black
================
- ver 0.0: The MLO is started up by the ROM and is generated by the
  “home-brewed” tool-chain that build the software and append the necessary 
  header on the MLO (see append_gp_header.c).

- ver 1.0: Setup the user led’s and the UART0 on the BBB for communication, 
  a “Hello world” snippet. So far the example depend on the ROM that sets up 
  the PLL’s and the clocks in a proper manner.
