BeagleBone-Black
================
- ver 0.0: The MLO is started up by the ROM and is generated by the
  “home-brewed” tool-chain that build the software and append the necessary 
  header on the MLO (see append_gp_header.c).

- ver 1.0: Setup the user led’s and the UART0 on the BBB for communication, 
  a “Hello world” snippet. So far the example depend on the ROM that sets up 
  the PLL’s and the clocks in a proper manner.

- ver 1.1: Fixed line formatting. Added a test setting up the clocks needed by 
  UART0. This is originally done by the ROM code, but this is overwriting the 
  ROM set-up and is just a pure test; remove it if you like, it doesn’t add any 
  extra value... 

- ver 1.2: Added some functions in the file misc.s. The added functions are:
  ItoA32_Hex (32 bit integer to ascii hex format), HexDump and Div32

- ver 1.3: The pll’s and clock’s needed by DDR3 512 MB SDRAM on EMIF is 
  configured and are up and running.

- ver 1.4: Cleaned up the make and linker scripts.

- ver 1.5: Added a setup of the L3 EMIF DDR3 SDRAM found on the BBB. In addition
           a linear test of the SDRAM has has been added. This is not a full
           test, just an indication the SDRAM has been set up correct.
